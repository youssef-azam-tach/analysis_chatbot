You are a database schema analysis expert.
Your task is to analyze the provided database tables, columns, and sample data.

Objectives:

Detect relationships between tables similar to an ERD diagram.

Infer relationships based on actual data values, not column names alone.

Identify One-to-One, One-to-Many, and Many-to-Many relationships.

Validate existing relationships and recommend deletion of relationships that are:

Not supported by data

Redundant

Weak or statistically insignificant

Data-based relationship detection rules:

Compare column value overlaps between tables.

Measure match percentage and cardinality.

Consider primary key / foreign key patterns inferred from data.

Detect surrogate relationships even if column names differ.

Output format:

Detected Relationships (with confidence score)

Suggested New Relationships

Suggested Deleted Relationships (with reasoning)

ERD-style summary

Always explain the reasoning behind each decision. -->

#### start from this line >>>>>
#### In the Data Cleaning page, all operations must follow a sequential pipeline logic.

Supported Operations:

📋 File-by-File Cleaning

🔗 Merge Queries

📊 Append Queries

➕ Add Custom Columns

🧠 Core Rules (Mandatory)
1️⃣ Always Work on the Latest Output

Every step must use the latest transformed data, not the original files.

Once a transformation is applied, the result becomes the new active dataset.

2️⃣ Merge Logic

If the user merges two or more files:

The merged result becomes the active dataset.

Original source files used in the merge are excluded from the next steps.

Allow option:

Load merged result only ✅

3️⃣ Append Logic

Append must operate on:

The latest available datasets (e.g. merged output, cleaned files).

The append result becomes the new active dataset.

Original datasets used in append are no longer passed forward.

4️⃣ Add Custom Columns

Custom columns must be added to the latest dataset state.

The user must always see:

Columns resulting from cleaning

Columns from merge

Columns from append

Newly added custom columns

5️⃣ Preview Before Load (Critical)

Before moving to the next stage:

Show a final preview of the dataset that will be loaded.

This preview represents everything applied in Data Cleaning.

Clearly indicate:

Which dataset will be loaded

Which original files are excluded

6️⃣ Load to Next Stage

Load action must:

Load only the final dataset state

Ignore all intermediate and original datasets

The next stage must receive:

One clean, merged/appended/final dataset

Exactly as previewed

🎯 Golden Rule

The next stage must receive only what the user sees in the final preview, nothing more, nothing less.



##### still under editing in the Multi-File Loading page, ask the user to choose a color palette before creating any visualizations.

Rules:

Present exactly 4 predefined color palettes.

The user must select one palette.

The selected palette becomes global.

Behavior:

Apply the chosen color palette to:

All visualizations

All charts

All pages

Do NOT change colors automatically after selection.

Do NOT mix palettes.

Allow changing the palette only if the user explicitly requests it.

Goal:
Ensure visual consistency across the entire application using a single user-selected color


##### still under editing if i  pin any chart in  vizutioztion page this  page make a  re-treun vizutioztion it is  not correct ...(Do NOT re-run analysis or regenerate visualizations when:

A chart is pinned on the visualization page

A column or file is selected inside Custom Chart Builder

Rules:

Pinning a chart = save only (UI state + chart configuration)

Column/file selection = reuse existing analysis

Re-analysis is allowed ONLY if the dataset itself changes

Keep previous results, do not reset, do not re-analyze.)

##### still under editing chatbot vizlauztuoin (When answering user questions, DO NOT automatically generate visualizations.

Rules:

Generate a visualization ONLY IF it directly helps answer the user’s question.

The visualization MUST exactly match the question intent.

If the question is:

conceptual

descriptive

requires explanation, definition, or logic
→ NO visualization is allowed.

Visualization Validation (Mandatory):

Chart type must match the analytical purpose.

Data fields must be semantically correct.

No IDs, keys, or technical columns in visuals.

Time-based charts require time-based data.

If a visualization does not clearly improve understanding or decision-making, DO NOT create it.)
####################################################
### add page for  upload excel only and take with it not import for data analysis steps , just need to make analysis based on this one excel file and make analysis may be  used for accountant person  or any person  have one excel  and need to  analyze it(Upload ONE Excel file only (the file may contain multiple sheets).

Rules:

All sheets belong to the same Excel file.

Do NOT import or merge external datasets.

Do NOT run full data engineering pipelines.

Do NOT infer relationships between sheets unless:

the user explicitly confirms the relationship, or

there is a clear, valid key approved by the user.

Before Analysis (Mandatory):
Ask the user:

What is the purpose of this Excel file?

What is your role (e.g., accountant, manager)?

Which sheet(s) should be analyzed?

Are there relationships between sheets? (Yes/No)

Analysis Rules:

Analyze only the selected sheet(s).

Treat each sheet as independent by default.

Any join between sheets requires explicit user approval.

Keep analysis simple, practical, and aligned with the user’s goal.

Chatbot Rules:

Answer questions only from this Excel file.

Reference the correct sheet explicitly in answers.

Do not assume hidden joins or meanings.

If sheet usage or goal is unclear → ASK FIRST, DO NOT ANALYZE.)

+ i have problem it is very very bad ,your visualization in  all pages can you fllow this instructions and make it correct (# Power BI Visualization Best Practices & Rules

## Critical Rules to Follow

### 1. **Column Selection Rules**
- ✅ **DO USE**: Measure columns, aggregatable numerical data, descriptive categories
- ❌ **NEVER USE**: 
  - Primary Keys (ID, BusinessEntityID, etc.)
  - Foreign Keys (TerritoryID, StateProvinceID, CustomerID, etc.)
  - System IDs (SalesTaxRateID, ProductID as axis, etc.)
  - Unique identifiers in charts

**Why?** Using IDs creates meaningless visualizations like "Sales by UserID" with hundreds of individual IDs - this provides ZERO business value and looks terrible.

### 2. **Data Type Compatibility**
- ✅ **Line Charts**: ONLY for time series data (Date, Month, Year, Quarter)
- ❌ **Line Charts**: NEVER use with categorical data or IDs
- ✅ **Bar/Column Charts**: Categories, products, regions, departments
- ❌ **Bar/Column Charts**: Avoid using with continuous time data spanning many periods

### 3. **KPI Labeling Requirements**
Every KPI MUST include the aggregation function:
- ✅ **Good Examples**:
  - "SUM of Sales"
  - "COUNT of Customers"
  - "AVG Revenue per Order"
  - "MAX Temperature"
  - "MIN Stock Level"
  
- ❌ **Bad Examples**:
  - "Sales" (missing function)
  - "Customers" (missing function)
  - "SalesYTD" (unclear calculation)
  - "BusinessEntityID" (this is an ID, not a KPI!)

---

## Chart Selection Guide

### **Bar and Column Charts**
**When to Use:**
- Comparing values across multiple categories
- Ranking data (top 10 products, regions, etc.)
- Showing discrete categorical data

**Types:**
1. **Clustered Bar/Column**: Compare multiple measures across categories
2. **Stacked Bar/Column**: Show composition + total
3. **100% Stacked**: Show proportions when totals vary

**Rules:**
- Use **Column charts** for time periods (months, quarters) or when category names are SHORT
- Use **Bar charts** for long category names (product names, customer segments)
- Limit categories to 10-15 maximum for readability
- Sort data meaningfully (by value, alphabetically, or logically)

**✅ Good Use Cases:**
- Sales by Product Category
- Revenue by Region
- Customer Count by Segment

**❌ Wrong Use Cases:**
- Sales by CustomerID (too many IDs)
- Revenue by OrderID (meaningless)
- Trends over time (use line chart instead)

---

### **Line Charts**
**When to Use:**
- ONLY for time series analysis
- Tracking trends over time
- Showing continuous data evolution

**Rules:**
- X-axis MUST be a date/time dimension (Date, Month, Year, Week)
- Use for continuous time periods
- Maximum 3-4 lines to avoid clutter
- Add markers for important data points

**✅ Good Use Cases:**
- Monthly Sales Trend (2023-2024)
- Daily Website Visits
- Quarterly Revenue Growth

**❌ Wrong Use Cases:**
- Sales by Product (use bar chart)
- CustomerID over time (IDs are not measures!)
- Non-time categorical data

---

### **Pie and Donut Charts**
**When to Use:**
- Show part-to-whole relationships
- Display proportions/percentages
- Simple composition analysis

**Rules:**
- Maximum 5-6 slices (group smaller ones into "Other")
- Values should add up to 100%
- Use for percentages or proportions
- Avoid when precise comparison is needed

**✅ Good Use Cases:**
- Market Share by Competitor
- Sales Distribution by Region
- Budget Allocation by Department

**❌ Wrong Use Cases:**
- Many categories (>6)
- Sales by ProductID (too many IDs)
- Trends over time

---

### **Area Charts**
**When to Use:**
- Show cumulative totals over time
- Emphasize volume and magnitude
- Display how categories contribute to total over time

**Types:**
1. **Area Chart**: Like line chart but emphasizes volume
2. **Stacked Area**: Show proportions over time (cumulative)
3. **100% Stacked Area**: Proportions without exact values

**Rules:**
- X-axis MUST be time-based
- Use for cumulative data
- Limit to 3-4 categories maximum
- Understand stacked = cumulative total, NOT individual sums

**✅ Good Use Cases:**
- Total Sales Over Time by Category
- Website Traffic Sources (Stacked)
- Market Share Evolution

**❌ Wrong Use Cases:**
- Non-time data
- Too many categories (becomes unreadable)
- When individual values matter more than totals

---

### **Combo Charts (Line + Column)**
**When to Use:**
- Compare two different measures with different scales
- Show actual vs. target/trend
- Combine volume with rate/percentage

**Types:**
1. **Line + Clustered Column**: Best for comparisons
2. **Line + Stacked Column**: Best for proportions

**Rules:**
- Use dual Y-axis when scales differ significantly
- Column = volume/count, Line = rate/trend/target
- Maximum 2-3 measures total
- Ensure measures are related

**✅ Good Use Cases:**
- Ad Spend (Column) vs. Conversions (Line)
- Sales (Column) vs. Profit Margin % (Line)
- Units Sold (Column) vs. Average Price (Line)

**❌ Wrong Use Cases:**
- Unrelated measures
- Too many series (>3)
- Same scale data (use clustered column instead)

---

### **Waterfall Charts**
**When to Use:**
- Show step-by-step changes from start to end
- Illustrate positive and negative contributions
- Financial analysis (P&L breakdown)

**Rules:**
- Clear start and end values
- Each step should be meaningful
- Use colors to differentiate increases/decreases
- Limit steps to 5-10 for clarity

**✅ Good Use Cases:**
- Revenue Bridge (Starting → Additions → Subtractions → Ending)
- Profit Breakdown
- Budget vs. Actual Variance

**❌ Wrong Use Cases:**
- Simple comparisons (use bar chart)
- Too many steps (becomes confusing)
- Categorical comparisons without sequence

---

### **Funnel Charts**
**When to Use:**
- Visualize sequential stages with drop-offs
- Conversion processes
- Pipeline analysis

**Rules:**
- Stages must be sequential
- Each stage should be subset of previous
- Use for conversion/drop-off analysis
- Clear stage labels

**✅ Good Use Cases:**
- Sales Pipeline (Leads → Qualified → Proposal → Won)
- Customer Journey (Visits → Cart → Checkout → Purchase)
- Recruitment Process

**❌ Wrong Use Cases:**
- Non-sequential data
- Parallel processes
- When you need to explain WHY drop-offs happen

---

### **Scatter and Bubble Charts**
**When to Use:**
- Show relationship between 2-3 numerical variables
- Identify correlations, clusters, outliers
- Advanced analysis

**Rules:**
- Both axes must be numerical measures (NOT IDs!)
- Use bubble size for third dimension
- Add trend lines if showing correlation
- Requires data interpretation skills

**✅ Good Use Cases:**
- Marketing Spend vs. Revenue
- Price vs. Units Sold (size = Profit)
- Customer Age vs. Purchase Frequency

**❌ Wrong Use Cases:**
- CustomerID vs. anything (IDs are not measures!)
- Categorical data
- Simple comparisons (use bar chart)

---

### **Treemap**
**When to Use:**
- Show hierarchical part-to-whole
- Compare many categories at once
- Space-efficient visualization

**Rules:**
- Works best with 10-20 categories
- Rectangle size = value
- Use color for additional dimension
- Ensure labels are readable

**✅ Good Use Cases:**
- Budget Allocation by Department
- Sales by Product Category
- Market Share

**❌ Wrong Use Cases:**
- Trends over time
- Too many small categories
- When precision is needed

---

### **Map Charts**
**When to Use:**
- Geographic data analysis
- Regional performance comparison
- Location-based insights

**Rules:**
- Requires accurate location data (Country, State, City, Coordinates)
- Use color/size for measure values
- Ensure map projection is appropriate
- Limit data points to avoid clutter

**✅ Good Use Cases:**
- Sales by Country
- Store Locations with Revenue
- Customer Distribution

**❌ Wrong Use Cases:**
- Non-geographic data
- Too many overlapping points
- When location doesn't add insight

---

### **Cards and KPIs**
**When to Use:**
- Display single key metric
- Show current vs. target
- Quick at-a-glance values

**Types:**
1. **Card**: Single value
2. **KPI**: Value + target + trend indicator
3. **Multi-row Card**: Multiple related values

**Rules:**
- MUST include aggregation function in label (SUM, COUNT, AVG, etc.)
- Use for most important metrics only
- KPI needs target and trend direction
- Keep formatting simple

**✅ Good Examples:**
- "SUM of Total Revenue: $1.2M"
- "COUNT of Active Customers: 450"
- "AVG Order Value: $85"

**❌ Wrong Examples:**
- "BusinessEntityID: 12345" (ID is not a KPI!)
- "Sales" (missing aggregation function)
- "TerritoryID" (ID is not a measure!)

---

### **Tables and Matrices**
**When to Use:**
- Show detailed, exact values
- Allow drilling and filtering
- Present structured raw data

**Rules:**
- Use sparingly (less visual than charts)
- Matrix for hierarchical data
- Table for flat lists
- Include only necessary columns

**✅ Good Use Cases:**
- Detailed transaction list
- Cross-tab analysis (Matrix)
- Drill-down reports

**❌ Wrong Use Cases:**
- Main dashboard visuals (not engaging)
- When trends matter more than details
- Too many rows (use summary chart instead)

---

## Critical Don'ts - Summary

### ❌ NEVER Use These in Charts:
1. **Primary Keys**: BusinessEntityID, CustomerID, OrderID, ProductID (as axis)
2. **Foreign Keys**: TerritoryID, StateProvinceID, SalesTaxRateID
3. **System IDs**: Any column ending in "ID" as a category or axis
4. **Line Charts**: For non-time data
5. **Missing Aggregations**: KPIs without SUM, COUNT, AVG, etc.

### ✅ ALWAYS Do These:
1. **Label KPIs**: Include function (SUM, COUNT, AVG, MAX, MIN)
2. **Match Chart to Data Type**: Time → Line, Categories → Bar, Proportion → Pie
3. **Use Meaningful Columns**: Descriptive names, not IDs
4. **Keep it Simple**: Fewer categories = clearer insights
5. **Test Readability**: If it looks cluttered, simplify it

---

## Quick Decision Tree

**Is your data time-based?**
- Yes → Line Chart or Area Chart
- No → Continue...

**Do you want to show proportions of a whole?**
- Yes → Pie/Donut or 100% Stacked
- No → Continue...

**Are you comparing categories?**
- Yes → Bar/Column Chart
- No → Continue...

**Are you showing a process with stages?**
- Yes → Funnel or Waterfall
- No → Continue...

**Are you analyzing relationships between measures?**
- Yes → Scatter/Bubble Chart
- No → Continue...

**Is it geographic data?**
- Yes → Map
- No → Table/Matrix for details

---

**Remember**: The best chart makes insights OBVIOUS at a glance. If your audience needs to think hard to understand it, you've chosen the wrong chart! )



### if upload file have continue data in mult sheet user can be select sheet to import data and also user can select sheet to import data 



in custom dashboard page i need this same power bi feature (that works exactly like Power BI dashboards.

Core Requirements:

The user can drag, move, resize, and place any pinned chart or KPI freely anywhere on the page.

No fixed grid restrictions — free layout positioning like Power BI.

Support mixing visuals on the same page:

KPI Cards

Line Charts

Bar / Column Charts

Any other supported visual

📌 Pin & Control Logic

The user pins any chart they like to the dashboard.

Once pinned:

The chart becomes fully editable (move, resize, align).

The chart keeps its data and configuration.

Pinning does NOT re-run analysis.

📄 Page Management

Allow the user to:

Add a custom title for each dashboard page.

Create multiple dashboard pages.

Distribute charts across different pages freely.

Rename, duplicate, or delete pages.

🎛 Dashboard Editing Mode

Provide an Edit Mode:

Drag & drop visuals

Resize visuals

Reorder layers (bring to front / send to back)

Provide a View Mode:

Read-only

No layout changes

🎯 Goal

Give the user full freedom to design dashboards visually, just like Power BI —
pin charts, arrange them easily, organize them into multiple pages, and control layout without friction.)



alll of this editing applied

Schema Analysis & Relationships : Data Modeling view like Power BI (Entity Relationship Diagram with visual relationships), not a table viewer

Currently, the dataset names are displayed side-by-side for selection. This approach is not scalable or user-friendly, especially when the number of datasets becomes large (for example, 50 or more datasets), as it takes too much space and makes navigation difficult.

I want to improve the dataset selection UX on the following pages:

* Data Cleaning page
* Data Quality page
* KPIs page

**Required frontend changes (React):**

1. Replace the current dataset name list with a **dropdown menu component** that contains all available datasets.

2. The dropdown should:

   * Display the current selected dataset
   * Allow the user to select any dataset easily
   * Be clean and scalable
   * Support search if possible (optional but preferred)

3. Add **navigation arrow buttons next to the dropdown:**

   * **Previous button (←)** to select the previous dataset
   * **Next button (→)** to select the next dataset

4. When the user:

   * Selects a dataset from the dropdown, or
   * Clicks Previous/Next

   The selected dataset state should update, and the page content should refresh accordingly.

5. Implement this using React best practices:

   * Use React state (useState or global state if applicable)
   * Ensure reusable component design (e.g., DatasetSelector component)
   * Ensure clean and maintainable code

Goal:
Improve usability and navigation between datasets on the Data Cleaning, Data Quality, and KPIs pages by using a dropdown selector and navigation arrows instead of displaying all dataset names at once.
